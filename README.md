## 📖 About

**Paperless-AI** is an AI-powered extension for [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) that brings automatic document classification, smart tagging, and semantic search using OpenAI-compatible APIs and Ollama.

This fork collects pending upstream PRs, applies security patches, and tests improvements. Since the upstream project is no longer actively maintained, it has grown into the most up-to-date version available.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Lite version** – AI tagging only (~500–700 MB):

```yaml
services:
  paperless-ai:
    image: admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-lite
    container_name: paperless-ai-next
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - PAPERLESS_AI_INITIAL_SETUP=yes
```

**Full version** – AI tagging + RAG semantic search (~1.5–2 GB):

```yaml
services:
  paperless-ai:
    image: admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-full
    container_name: paperless-ai-next
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - PAPERLESS_AI_INITIAL_SETUP=yes
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to complete setup.

> ⚠️ **First-time install:** Restart the container **after completing setup** to build the RAG index (Full version only).
