# Manual Tagging

Sometimes you want to process a specific document right now, or re-process one with different settings. The Manual page at **/manual** lets you do exactly that.

## How to use it

1. Navigate to **Manual** in the sidebar
2. Search for or select the document you want to process
3. Click **Analyze** – the AI processes the document and shows you the suggested tags, title, document type, and correspondent
4. Review the suggestions and click **Apply** to save them to Paperless-ngx

## When is manual processing useful?

- A document wasn't picked up by the automatic scan
- You want to re-classify a document with your current AI/settings
- You're testing how the AI handles a specific document type
- You want to quickly process a single document without waiting for the next scan cycle

## Playground

The **Playground** (accessible via the sidebar) lets you test AI analysis on arbitrary text without touching any real documents. Paste any text and see what tags and metadata the AI would assign. Useful for fine-tuning your prompts and settings before applying them to your actual archive.
