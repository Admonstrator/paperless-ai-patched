title: "SEC-002: Fix urllib3 Decompression-Bomb Vulnerability"
---

Use this page as the canonical template for documenting any new fix.

## Feature / Problem Description

A vulnerable urllib3 version in the Python dependency chain exposed the service to decompression-bomb behavior during specific redirect/streaming scenarios.

## Implementation

- Updated urllib3 minimum version to a fixed release.
- Regenerated dependency state to ensure patched package resolution.
- Verified no functional regressions in RAG/HTTP usage after the update.

## Testing

This fix was verified with the standard project checks:

```bash
npm run test
npm run docs:build
```

## Impact

- Security: Upgrading urllib3 removes exposure to the documented decompression-bomb vulnerability path.
- Functionality / UX: Python HTTP-dependent features continue to operate without behavior regressions.
